# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains code and prompts for managing projects with the following organization:

- `src/` - All prompts and code should be placed here
- `input/` - Input text files
- `output/` - Generated output files

Note: These directories are not yet created but should be used as the codebase develops.

## Development

This is a Python project. Currently there are no dependencies, build tools, or test frameworks configured.

The `main.py` file in the root is a PyCharm boilerplate and should likely be removed or replaced as actual project code is added to `src/`.

## Git Commit Guidelines

When creating commits, do not add Claude Code attribution or co-author information to commit messages.
